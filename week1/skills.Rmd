This page introduces some of the skill that are useful for displaying
geospatial data on a map using R, Python, QGIS, or ARcGIS.

The R skills on this page use the following R packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tigris)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggthemes)
```

In order to run Python code from RStudio, I'm using the `reticulate`
package and setting up my RStudio environment so it knows where I 
have Python installed. Just because you _can_ run Python in RStudio, doesn't 
mean you should. You might be better served by PyCharm or Jupyter notebooks.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = here("env_2128/Scripts/python.exe"))
use_virtualenv(here("env_2128"))
```

The Python skills on this page use the following Python packages.

```{python}
import geopandas
import pygris
import pandas

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from pyprojroot.here import here
from geopandas.tools import sjoin
```

# Loading data

A first step in working with geospatial data is loading it into 
the software you are working with.

## R

Some packages (such as the `tigris` package) will load data
directly from an online source (so you need to be connected to the 
internet for these functions to work). 

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
states <- states()
rails <- rails()
TX_landmarks <- landmarks(state = "TX")
```

Other packages (such as `rnaturalearth`) include geospatial datasets (the
data was installed on your computer along with the package, so they will
work regardless of whether you are connected to the internet).

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(rnaturalearth)

africa <- ne_countries(continent = "Africa", returnclass = "sf")
```


The `st_read` funtion (from the `sf` package) will read
data from a file in any common data format. 

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(here)

open_space <- here("week1",
                   "data",
                   "Open_Space.geojson") |>
  st_read()
```

For shapefiles, use the name of the directory containing the set of 
files.

```{r, results='hide'}
community_c <- here("week1",
                    "data",
                    "Community_Centers") |>
  st_read()
```

## Python

`pygris` is the Python version of `tigris` and can download TIGER
files via the census API. It is not as complete as `tigris`.

```{python, message=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
states = pygris.states()

rails = pygris.rails()
```

You can load spatial data from a file using the `read_file` function
in the `geopandas` package. To read shapefiles, reference the directory
containing the set of files.

```{python}
open_space = geopandas.read_file(here("week1/data/Open_Space.geojson"))

guam_places = geopandas.read_file(here("week1/data/tl_2022_66_place"))
```

## QGIS

In QGIS, you can load a layer by dragging and dropping it into 
the main window. This can be either a single geospatial file (like
a geojson file or a kml file) or a directory containing a shapefile (along
with its associated files).

Once the dataset is loaded in QGIS, you'll see it listed in your
layers panel and displayed in the map panel.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Gif 1: Loading datasets in QGIS", out.width = '100%'}
here("week1",
     "examples",
     "qgis-gifs",
     "load-layers.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## ArcGIS

In ArcGIS Pro, click on the "Add Data" button on the Map tab, navigate to the 
shapefile you want to load, and select OK.

Once the dataset is loaded in ArcGIS, you'll see it listed in your
contents panel and displayed in the map panel.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Gif 2: Loading a shapefile in ArcGIS Pro", out.width = '100%'}
here("week1",
     "examples",
     "arcgis-gifs",
     "load-shp.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

# Filtering data by attribute

You may have loaded a set of features that includes some categories
you aren't interested in. 

## R

You can use the `filter` function to filter based on the value
of a variable.

```{r}
texas <- states |>
  filter(NAME == "Texas")

TX_cemeteries <- TX_landmarks |>
  filter(MTFCC == "K2582")
```


## Python

```{python}
RI_state = states[states['NAME'] == 'Rhode Island']
```

## QGIS

In QGIS, you'll do this in two steps. First, you'll select features
based on an attribute value. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Gif 3: Selecting by attribute in QGIS", out.width = '100%'}
here("week1",
     "examples",
     "qgis-gifs",
     "select-by-attr.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Then, you'll export your selection as a new layer.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Gif 4: Exporting selected features in QGIS", out.width = '100%'}
here("week1",
     "examples",
     "qgis-gifs",
     "exp-select.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

# Filtering data by location

You may have loaded data for a large area, and you're only interested 
in the features within a smaller area. 

## R

You can use `st_filter` to keep only the features within
a polygon.

```{r}
TX_rails <- rails |>
  st_filter(texas)
```

## Python

In Python, you can do this in two steps: 

1. A spatial join (`sjoin`) will add columns from the polygon containing
each feature. Features that aren't in a polygon will have NA (missing) values.
2. `dropna` will filter out the rows with an NA value for a column
that comes from the polygon you used in the spatial join.

```{python}
is_rail_in_RI = sjoin(rails, RI_state, how = 'left')

RI_rails = is_rail_in_RI.dropna(subset=['STATEFP'])
```


# Viewing data in a map

It can be helpful to take an initial look at your data on a map. ArcGIS
and QGIS will display your data in a map panel when you load it. In R or 
Python, you'll need to create some kind of plot to visualize your data.

## R (interactive)

The `leaflet` package in R can create interactive, html-based maps. These
can be useful for exploring your data even if you ultimately want to be
producing a static map. You can read about `leaflet` here: https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/

Set up the leaflet map with a call to the `leaflet()` function. Use the 
`addTiles()` function if you want to display your data over a default
OpenStreetMap base map. Then use `addPolygons()` to add polygon data,
`addPolylines()` to add line data, or `addCircleMarkers()` to add point
data.

A useful trick if you just want to explore your data is to specify a 
popup that will give you the value of a variable when you click on 
a feature.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  addPolygons(data = texas, 
              popup = ~NAME) |>
  addPolylines(data = TX_rails, 
               popup = ~FULLNAME, 
               color = "red") |>
  addCircleMarkers(data = TX_cemeteries,
                   popup = ~FULLNAME,
                   color = "black") 
```

## R (static)

You can also make a quick static plot of a dataset using `ggplot`.

```{r}
ggplot(texas) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = TX_rails,
          color = "red")
```

## Python (interactive)

The `explore` function in `geopandas` is useful for creating a quick
interactive map. By default, it will display the layer over OpenStreetMap tiles
and add popups displaying values for all variables.

In the code below, I'm creating the interactive map and saving it as an 
html file. I can embed that map within my knitted RMarkdown document
by adding the line `![](examples/guam_places.html){width=100% height=500px}`
below the chunk (not within any code chunk).

In a Jupyter notebook, you wouldn't need to save and embed the map. It would
just render below your code chunk.

```{python}
int_map = RI_state.explore()
int_map = RI_rails.explore(m = int_map, color = 'red')

int_map.save("examples/RI_rail.html")
```


![](examples/RI_rail.html){width=100% height=500px}


## Python (static)

To create a static map in Python, use the `plot` function.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
stat_map = texas.plot()
stat_map = TX_rails.plot(ax = stat_map, color = 'red')

plt.savefig("examples/texas_rail.png")
```

![](examples/texas_rail.png)

# Styling your layers

You can control the appearance of features on your map by
defining some of the following attributes

* Polygons
    * Fill color
    * Fill opacity
    * Fill pattern
    * Line color
    * Line opacity
    * Line weight
* Lines
    * Color
    * Opacity
    * Weight
* Points
    * Size
    * Shape
    * Color
    * Opacity
    
## R (interactive)

In `leaflet`, `addPolygons` and `addCircleMarkers` have the following optional arguments:

* `stroke` controls whether there will be a line border around the polygon. 
The default is `TRUE`.
* `fill` controls whether the polygon will be filled. The default is `TRUE`.
If you set both `stroke` and `fill` to false, the polygon will be invisible.
* `color` controls the color of the border.
* `opacity` controls the transparency/opacity of the border. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is
fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent.
* `weight` controls the line weight of the border. 
* `fillColor` controls the fill color.
* `fillOpacity` controls the fill opacity. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is
fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent.

In addition, `addCircleMarkers` has an argument for `radius` that controls
the size of the circles.

`addPolylines` has optional arguments for `color`, `opacity`, and `weight`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
leaflet() |>
  addPolygons(data = texas, 
              popup = ~NAME,
              stroke = FALSE,
              fillOpacity = 1,
              fillColor = "white") |>
  addPolylines(data = TX_rails, 
               popup = ~FULLNAME, 
               color = "gray",
               weight = 1,
               opacity = 1) |>
  addCircleMarkers(data = TX_cemeteries,
                   popup = ~FULLNAME,
                   color = "black",
                   radius = 0.5,
                   opacity = 1) 
```

## R (static)

In `ggplot`, you can set the following optional arguments in the
`geom_sf` function:

* `color` sets the color of a point or a line, or the outline
color of a polygon (set `color = NA` for a polygon with no outline).
* `fill` sets the fill color of a polygon (set `fill = NA` for 
a polygon with no fill).
* `alpha` sets the transparency of a feature. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is
fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent.
* `linewidth` sets the weight of a line (or the outline of a polygon).
* `linetype` sets the style of a line. Options include:
    * `solid`
    * `longdash`
    * `dotted`
    * `dotdash`
    * `dashed`
* `size` sets the size of a point
* `shape` sets the shape of a point. The most common options are 
indicated by numbers 0 through 25. Common options include
    * 20 for a small, filled circle
    * 15 for a square
    * 17 for a triangle
    * 18 for a diamond

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = texas,
          color = NA,
          fill = "cornsilk") +
  geom_sf(data = TX_rails,
          color = "black",
          linewidth = 0.5,
          linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_sf(data = TX_cemeteries,
          size = 4,
          shape = 18,
          color = "darkgreen",
          alpha = 0.5)
  
```

# Styling your plot

You can also change the appearance of the plot itself.

## R (static)

In `ggplot`, you'll set the overall appearance of a plot using the
`theme` function. In the example below, I'm removing the tick marks
and axis text, setting the panel background to be light blue, and setting
the grid lines (which are latitude and longitude lines in this case) to be
dotted, darker blue lines.

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "blue",
                                        linetype = "dotted"))
```

Rather than messing around with all the details you can set in the `theme`
function, you can also use one of many pre-defined themes. Most of 
these were developed for use with scatter plots rather than maps.

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_light()
```

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_linedraw()
```

For maps, you often don't want to show grid lines or axis text. 
`theme_void` will remove all of this from your plot.

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_void()
```

The ggthemes package has a number of interesting pre-defined themes. Again, most 
of them were developed for scatter plots. Here is a plot in the Wall Street Journal 
house style.

```{r}
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_wsj()
```

`ggthemes` also has a function called `theme_map` that gives you a nice, clean-looking
map. You'll notice that it looks a lot like `theme_void`. The main difference is 
in how the legend appears (not relevant in this example that doesn't
have a legend).

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_map()
```

# Adding a legend

## R (static)

To include an item in a legend, you specify its appearance a little differently.
In the example below, I replace `linetype = "dotted"` with `aes(linetype = "Railroad")`
so that the item will appear in a legend labeled as "Railroad." Then I add 
the function `scale_linetype_manual` to create a legend based on line type, and
I specify the line type for railroads within that function.

I do something similar to create a color-based legend for cemeteries.

Note that this is actually creating two seperate legends (one for line types and one
for colors) so I'm using the `legend.title` argument in the `theme` function 
to remove all the legend titles.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = texas,
          color = NA,
          fill = "cornsilk") +
  geom_sf(data = TX_rails,
          color = "black",
          linewidth = 0.5,
          aes(linetype = "Railroad")) +
  geom_sf(data = TX_cemeteries,
          size = 4,
          shape = 18,
          aes(color = "Cemetery"),
          alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = "darkgreen") +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = "dotted") +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
  
```

# Adding a north arrow

A north arrow is not always necessary, but it can be helpful depending on your audience
and on the purpose of your map.

## R (static)

The `ggspatial` package includes an `annotation_north_arrow` function that will 
add a north arrow to your map. It includes the following arguments:

* `location` indicates where the north arrow will be displayed. Options
include `tl` (top left), `tr` (top right), `bl` (bottom left), and `br` 
(bottom right)
* `style` indicates the arrow style. Options include:
    * north_arrow_orienteering
    * north_arrow_fancy_orienteering
    * north_arrow_minimal
    * north_arrow_nautical

```{r}
ggplot(africa) +
  geom_sf() +
  annotation_north_arrow(location = "tr",
                         style = north_arrow_minimal) +
  theme_map()
```

# Adding a scale bar

## R (static)

The `ggspatial` package includes an `annotation_scale` function that will 
add a scale bar to your map. It includes the following arguments:

* `location` indicates where the scale bar will be displayed. Options
include `tl` (top left), `tr` (top right), `bl` (bottom left), and `br` 
(bottom right)
* `style` indicates the scale bar style: either `"bars"` or `"ticks"`.

```{r}
ggplot(open_space) +
  geom_sf() +
  annotation_scale(location = "br",
                   style = "ticks") +
  theme_map()
```

# Adding annotation

The easiest way to annotate a static map may be to bring it into illustrator, but you
can also do it within your GIS program.

## R (static)

The `annotate` function will place text on your map. You need to specify
the following arguments:

* `geom`: Set `geom = "text"` to place text on the map.
* `x`, `y`: The x- and y-coordinates of the location the text 
should be placed, in the coordinate system of the map (if you're 
plotting the map without grid lines, you might want to make a quick 
plot that shows them so you can find the right values to place your annotation).
* `label`: The text you want to place. There is no text wrapping; you can use
`\n` within your next string to move to a new line.

The following optional arguments are also helpful:

* `hjust`: The horizontal justification of your text. The default is 
0.5, which indicates centered text (and x-coordinate you've used
to place the text will be for the middle of the text). A value of 0 
will give you left-justified text, and a value of 1 will give you
right-justified text.
* `vjust`: The vertical justification of your text. A value of 
0.5 means the y-coordinate you've specified is for the center
of the text. A value of 0 means the y-coordinate is for the
bottom of the text. A value of 1 means the y-coordiate is for the top of 
the text.

```{r}
ggplot(open_space) +
  geom_sf() +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = -71.1,
           y = 42.25,
           label = "This is a map of\nopen space in Boston",
           hjust = 0,
           vjust = 1) 
```

# Saving your map

Please don't just take screenshots of the maps you create in a GIS program. You can 
save them to a variety of file types.

## R (static)

The `ggsave` function give you a nice easy way to save a `ggplot` map. By default,
it saves your most recent plot. You should specify the following arguments:

* `filename`: The name of the file. `ggsave` will guess the file format (e.g. jpg, png, pdf)
based on the filename's extension. You can pipe the path from the `here()` function 
to make sure you end up in the right directory.
* `width`, `height`: The dimensions of the image you want to save.
* `units`: The units of the dimensions you've specified, one of:
   * `"in"` for inches
   * `"cm"` for centimeters
   * `"mm"` for millimeters
   * `"px"` for pixels
   
For raster images (e.g. jpg or png), you should also specify the resolution with `dpi=`.

```{r}
here("week1", 
     "examples",
     "open-space.pdf") |>
  ggsave(width = 11,
         height = 8.5,
         units = "in")
```
